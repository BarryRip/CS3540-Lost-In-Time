## Set Up
This project was built using Unity version 2022.3.18f1. If you don't already
have it installed, [this link](unityhub://2022.3.18f1/d29bea25151d) will prompt
you to install it through Unity Hub.

To set up the project on your end for the very first time, clone this repo onto
your machine. Then, through Unity Hub, open up the LostInTime folder as a Unity
project. This should load the project in Unity.

## Development Notes
If you make any changes to the project, make sure to do so in your own branch
first. Then you can open a pull request in GitHub to merge your branch with the
main branch.
