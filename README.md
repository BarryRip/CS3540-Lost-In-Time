## Set Up
This project was built using Unity version 2022.3.18f1. If you don't already
have it installed, you can find the release
[here](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.18).

To set up the project on your end for the very first time, clone this repo onto
your machine. Then, through Unity Hub, open up the LostInTime folder as a Unity
project. This should load the project in Unity. From there, all packages and
project settings should be initialized properly for the Unity project.

## Development Notes
If you make any changes to the project, make sure to do so in your own branch
first. Then you can open a pull request in GitHub to merge your branch with the
main branch.
